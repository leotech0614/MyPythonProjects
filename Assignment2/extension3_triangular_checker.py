--------------------------
This program asks our user for input and checks if the input is an
triangular number or not.

The triangular number (Tn) is a number that can be represented in the form of a triangular
grid of points where the first row contains a single element and each subsequent row contains 
one more element than the previous one.

We can just use the fact that the nth triangular number can be found by using a formula: Tn = n(n + 1) / 2.

The program ends when the user enter the EXIT number.
